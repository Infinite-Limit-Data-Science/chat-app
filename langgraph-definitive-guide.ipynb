    "DAG-based (Directed Acyclic Graph) solutions:\n",
    "Workflows are explicitly laid out as a sequence of tasks in a graph structure that has no cycles (i.e., you can’t come back around to a previous task). This is great for predictable, linear (or branching) pipelines—like ETL jobs or Airflow workflows—because you have a clear, static order of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic architecture:\n",
    "Instead of predefining an entire workflow graph, you have a more dynamic “agent” that decides which step to take next based on the current context and goal. Rather than strictly following a graph of tasks, the agent can observe intermediate outputs and adjust its strategy on the fly, including calling different tools or subroutines, updating its own plan, or taking new paths altogether if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A DAG-based solution has a predetermined path: Task A flows into Task B, into Task C, etc. It might allow branching, but the overall structure is fixed.\n",
    "- An agentic approach lets the system “choose” what to do next at runtime. Each step can vary depending on the agent’s reasoning, available tools, or new information gleaned partway through the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a DAG, each task often just takes an input from upstream tasks, does its job, and passes the output downstream.\n",
    "- In an agentic system, the agent maintains a form of memory or persistent state and can evaluate partial results in a loop. It can re-check or refine previous reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DAGs shine when the flow is well-known in advance: e.g., you need to transform data, then validate, then load, in a fixed sequence.\n",
    "- An agentic approach is more suitable when the path to the final answer is uncertain or can change based on intermediate discoveries. The agent can decide to call additional APIs, explore different sub-tasks, or re-run certain steps to improve the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In DAG-based solutions, the flow is “procedure-oriented”: you list out steps to get from start to finish.\n",
    "- In an agentic architecture, you define a goal, and the agent figures out the steps (sometimes called “self-prompting” or “chain-of-thought”) to move toward that goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langgraph is a multi-agent workflow. Langgraph supports cycles, controllability, and persistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, a DAG-based workflow doesn’t allow loops—it’s a Directed Acyclic Graph by definition. With agentic flows, you can revisit previous steps, refine them, or run iterative loops (“cycles”) until you reach some confidence level or result. This is key for more open-ended tasks where you might need multiple “tries” or repeated reasoning steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controllability\n",
    "\n",
    "In an agentic system, you can guide (or “control”) the flow of decisions at a higher level. Rather than letting the agent blindly keep trying, you can define rules, constraints, or checkpoints. This ensures the agent doesn’t go off-track and can be nudged or constrained in certain directions, depending on your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistence means the system can “remember” what happened before—even if you stop and restart the process. For example, if your agent is building a piece of content or executing a multi-step workflow, it can store intermediate results, partial solutions, or the agent’s own state in a database or memory. This way, you can resume where you left off, audit what happened so far, or trace how the solution evolved over time.\n",
