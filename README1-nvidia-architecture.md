### Comptia A+ Terms

In Generative AI, the GPUs, the physical chip on a Graphic Card's PCB, steal the spotlight. While the CPU's diverse range of instructions on its Infrastructure Set Architecture can handle the tasks associated with the Operating System and many applications, it has other limitations not suitable for Generative AI. Transformer-based Neural Networks require high parallelism and abundancy, which, unlike CPUs, the Graphic Card's GPU can provide. Unlike CPUs, which are optimized for serial processing, GPUs are designed to handle the massive parallel computations required for training large neural networks. Since Generative AI relies on concurrency, like graphics cards rendering pixels on screen, the processing where one task is executed one after another, in a sequential manner, is not practical. Further, a modern CPU has 8 cores at least. A modern graphics card has between 1000 and 4000 cores. While one GPU Core cannot compare with one CPU Core, the thousands of GPU cores can accelerate matrix multiplication and other linear algebra operations, the staple of the Transformer architecture.

As the GPU capacity advances, so does the system motherboard's ability to accommodate. The system crystal oscillator provides a stable clock signal to the CPU and other components on the motherboard, including the GPU. As a simple example, this clock signal is used as a reference for Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM), which operates at the speed of the system clock. Hence, the use of the word "Synchronous". The DDR Speed Rating of SDRAM is typically twice the clock speed, and the PC Speed Rating is 8 times the DDR Speed Rating. However, with newer motherboards, the DDR Speed Rating is 4 times the Core RAM Clock Speed, and DDR3 is double DDR. The motherboard's ratings dictate what it can handle.

The CPU, with its much greater clock speed than the system crystal, relies on the external data bus to exchange data with external devices or components, such as memory modules, input/output (I/O) devices, and peripherals. When two devices with different oscillators (or two different clock domains on a GALS chip) need to transfer data to each other, they use a technique called clock domain crossing.

Conversely, the Graphics Card's GPU operates at a much higher frequency than the system clock, and it needs to communicate with the system memory and other components at a lower frequency. To achieve this, the GPU uses the same technique of clock domain crossing, which allows it to operate at a different clock frequency than the system clock.

The GPU Core Clock is the frequency at which the GPU is running measured in Hz. A Graphics Card often has a Boost Clock, the speed the card can boost itself under a heavy processing load. However, that speed drops right down if it gets too hot. This is called Thermal Throttling, the speed of the card drops down if it gets too hot. The V-RAM runs at a certain speed called the Memory Clock. This helps determine the memory bandwidth.

In fact, the GPU's clock speed is often the bottleneck in AI applications, as it determines how fast the GPU can perform matrix multiplications and other linear algebra operations. This is why NVIDIA's A100 GPUs, with their Tensor Cores and mixed-precision training capabilities, have become the standard for training large Transformer-based models.

New graphics architectures are created by AMD and NVida every 1 to 2 years. They often shrink the components of the physical GPU processor, which allows the companies to fit in more features and transistors onto the GPU Die (Die meaning the actual silicone in the chip). Architecture changes can also reduce the amount of power to run the Graphics Card. So it becomes difficult to compare different generations of graphics cards based on specs alone. Video RAM (V-RAM) serves the same function as System RAM. It holds whatever data is currently being accessed by the GPU.

### NVida Architectures: A100

Parallel computing involves distributing a large task across multiple processing units, allowing each unit to execute a subtask of the task simultaneously and reducing overall processing time. The key component of NVidia's GPU architecture that enables parallel computing is CUDA cores. These small but powerful processors work together to perform calculations in parallel, greatly enhancing the overall performance of the GPU.

The CUDA core's ability to execute instructions independently of other Cuda cores allows the NVidia GPUs to process vast amounts of data in parallel, making them ideal for computationally intensive applications. This capability is particularly valuable in fields such as gaming, scientific simulations, machine learning, and video rendering, where massive amounts of data need to be processed quickly and efficiently. By leveraging the power of parallel computing, NVidia GPUs can deliver exceptional performance and accelerate complex tasks.

NVIDIA's CUDA technology has gained widespread adoption among developers due to its user-friendly interface and extensive support from software libraries and frameworks. The CUDA programming model provides developers with a flexible and intuitive way to harness the power of parallel computing on NVIDIA GPUs, making it easier to develop high-performance applications. 

Tensor Cores, on the other hand, are specialized processing units on NVIDIA GPUs that are specifically designed for matrix multiplication and other linear algebra operations. They are optimized for deep learning workloads and are designed to accelerate the performance of neural networks. Tensor Cores are capable of performing matrix multiplication operations much faster than CUDA Cores, making them ideal for tasks such as deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

The NVidia A100 and H100 are intended for enterprise workloads. The Nvidia A100 was released in 2020, as part of the Ampere architecture. The Nvidia H100 was released in 2022, as part of the Hopper architecture. Here's the matchup:

- NVIDIA A100: The A100 GPU has 6,912 CUDA cores.

CUDA cores are just one factor in determining the performance of a GPU. While the A10G has more CUDA cores (9,216 compared to the A100's 6,912), the A100 is still superior due to several other architectural advancements and features.

- The A100 supports up to 80 GB of HBM2e (High Bandwidth Memory) and provides significantly higher memory bandwidth (over 2 TB/s) than the A10G, which uses GDDR6 memory. This leads to much faster data access, which is critical for AI and HPC tasks.
- The CUDA cores in the A100 are more efficient than those in the A10G, meaning they can do more work per clock cycle. The A100 is optimized for complex matrix operations and AI workloads that benefit from these enhancements.
- The A100's Tensor Cores give it a significant edge in matrix-heavy operations like deep learning. These cores enable FP16, BF16, INT8, and other mixed-precision computing, leading to exponential performance gains over traditional FP32 operations. Note the A10G does have Tensor Cores. The A10G is based on NVIDIA's Ampere architecture, similar to the A100, so it does include 3rd generation Tensor Cores. These Tensor Cores support mixed-precision operations and can accelerate AI training and inference workloads, but they are not as optimized or as numerous as those in the A100.
