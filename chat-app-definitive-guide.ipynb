    "### Few Shot Prompt Templates and Example Selectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Example Selectors in LangChain is to dynamically choose the most relevant examples to include in a prompt. This is especially important when you have a large dataset of examples and cannot include all of them due to constraints like token limits or relevance to the current input. Example selectors ensure that the chosen examples are tailored to the specific input, improving the quality of responses from the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models like GPT often perform better with few-shot learning, where the prompt includes input-output examples to demonstrate the task. Including irrelevant or too many examples can lead to suboptimal responses or exceed token limits.\n",

    "Example Selectors dynamically choose the most relevant subset of examples based on the current input, ensuring optimal context is provided to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides several prebuilt example selectors, and you can also implement custom ones. Common types include:\n",
    "- Similarity Selector\n",
    "    - huih\n",
    "- Max Marginal Relevance (MMR) Selector\n",
    "    - Balances relevance and diversity by selecting examples that are similar to the input but not too similar to each other.\n",
    "- Length-Based Selector\n",
    "    - Chooses examples that fit within a token limit or are of a similar length to the input.\n",
    "- N-gram Overlap Selector\n",
    "    - Selects examples based on shared n-grams between the input and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select by length example selector selects which examples to use based on length.

    "\n",
    "One common use case for wanting to partial a prompt template is if you get some of the variables before others. For example, suppose you have a prompt template that requires two variables, foo and baz. If you get the foo value early on in the chain, but the baz value later, it can be annoying to wait until you have both variables in the same place to pass them to the prompt template. Instead, you can partial the prompt template with the foo value, and then pass the partialed prompt template along and just use that. Below is an example of doing this:\n",

    "partial_prompt = prompt.partial(foo=\"foo\")\n",
    "print(partial_prompt.format(bar=\"baz\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other common use is to partial with a function. The use case for this is when you have a variable you know that you always want to fetch in a common way. A prime example of this is with date or time. Imagine you have a prompt which you always want to have the current date. You can't hard code it in the prompt, and passing it along with the other input variables is a bit annoying. In this case, it's very handy to be able to partial the prompt with a function that always returns the current date.\n",

    "Tool Calling in LangChain is a feature that allows a language model to generate structured output by simulating the \"calling\" of a predefined tool. This process involves the model creating arguments that match a user-defined schema for a tool, but the actual execution of the tool (or even whether the tool is executed) is left to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define a tool in LangChain, we specify:\n",
    "- What the tool does: Its purpose or functionality.\n",
    "- What inputs (arguments) it requires: A schema that defines the parameters the tool needs to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model \"creates arguments\" by generating these input values based on the user's query or prompt. Consider a tool for basic arithmetic operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CalculatorTool(BaseTool):\n",
    "    name = \"calculate\"\n",
    "    args_schema = {\n",
    "        \"operation\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]},\n",
    "        \"num1\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n",
    "        \"num2\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Operation: Specifies the type of calculation (e.g., \"add\").\n",
    "- The first number for the operation (e.g., 5).\n",
    "- The second number for the operation (e.g., 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user provides input like: \"Add 5 and 7.\" The model interprets the query and generates the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"operation\": \"add\",\n",
    "    \"num1\": 5,\n",
    "    \"num2\": 7\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "These arguments match the schema defined in the example CalculatorTool.\n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, despite the name, tool calling does not involve the model directly performing actions. Instead, the model provides parameters or arguments that conform to the schema, which can then be used by the user to trigger the tool or extract structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Tool Calling Works:\n",
    "- Define the Tool:\n",
    "    - A \"tool\" in LangChain represents an action the model can \"call\" by generating arguments that match a predefined schema.\n",
    "    - The schema specifies the inputs the tool accepts and can include validations or constraints.\n",
    "- Prompt the Model:\n",
    "    - The user provides a prompt or query to the model.\n",
    "    - The model generates output that matches the schema of the tool, simulating a \"call\" to the tool.\n",
    "- User Handles the Execution:\n",
    "    - The user decides whether to actually execute the tool based on the generated arguments.\n",
    "    - Alternatively, the user may treat the structured output directly as the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many LLM providers, including Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Mistral, OpenAI, and others, support variants of a tool calling feature. These features typically allow requests to the LLM to include available tools and their schemas, and for responses to include calls to these tools. For instance, given a search engine tool, an LLM might handle a query by first issuing a call to the search engine. The system calling the LLM can receive the tool call, execute it, and return the output to the LLM to inform its response. LangChain includes a suite of built-in tools and supports several methods for defining your own custom tools. Tool-calling is extremely useful for building tool-using chains and agents, and for getting structured outputs from models more generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providers adopt different conventions for formatting tool schemas and tool calls. For instance, Anthropic returns tool calls as parsed structures within a larger content block:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"text\": \"<thinking>\\nI should use a tool.\\n</thinking>\",\n",

    "    \"type\": \"tool_use\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- Binding Tools to the Model\n",
    "    - Tools must be bound to the model so that the model knows which tools are available and can generate arguments for them.\n",
    "    - Binding tools involves passing the tool schemas to the model, which adapts them to the specific format expected by the provider’s API (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).\n",
    "- .bind_tools() Method\n",
    "    - The .bind_tools() method in LangChain allows you to attach tools to a ChatModel instance.\n",
    "    - Once tools are bound, every subsequent API call to the model will include the tool schemas, enabling the model to simulate invoking them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.tools import BaseTool\n",
    "\n",
    "class CalculatorTool(BaseTool):\n",
    "    name = \"calculate\"\n",
    "    description = \"Performs arithmetic operations\"\n",
    "    args_schema = {\n",
    "        \"operation\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"add\", \"subtract\", \"multiply\", \"divide\"]},\n",
    "        \"num1\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n",
    "        \"num2\": {\"type\": \"number\"},\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    def _run(self, operation, num1, num2):\n",
    "        if operation == \"add\":\n",
    "            return num1 + num2\n",
    "        elif operation == \"subtract\":\n",
    "            return num1 - num2\n",
    "        elif operation == \"multiply\":\n",
    "            return num1 * num2\n",
    "        elif operation == \"divide\":\n",
    "            return num1 / num2\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Invalid operation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use .bind_tools() to attach the tools to the model.\n",
    "from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instantiate the model\n",
    "llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)\n",

    "\n",
    "# Bind the tool to the model\n",
    "llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([calculator_tool])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How Binding Works:\n",
    "- Schema Passing:\n",
    "    - When you call .bind_tools(), LangChain converts the tool definitions into the specific JSON schema format expected by the provider (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic).\n",
    "- Model Awareness:\n",
    "    - After binding, the model becomes \"aware\" of the tools and their schemas. Every subsequent chat request automatically includes the tool schemas as part of the API call.\n",
    "- Tool Invocation by the Model:\n",
    "    - During a conversation, the model can decide whether to \"call\" a tool by generating arguments that match the tool schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you interact with the bound model, the model can now include tool invocations in its responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = llm_with_tools.invoke({\n",
    "    \"input\": \"Can you add 7 and 3?\"\n",
    "})\n",
    "\n",
    "print(response)\n",
    "\n",
    "# The model generates an output in the format:\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"tool\": \"calculate\",\n",
    "    \"arguments\": {\n",
    "        \"operation\": \"add\",\n",
    "        \"num1\": 7,\n",
    "        \"num2\": 3\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the schema for custom tools using the @tool decorator on Python functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.tools import tool\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Adds a and b.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        a: first int\n",

    "tools = [add, multiply]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can equivalently define the schema using Pydantic. Pydantic is useful when your tool inputs are more complex:\n",

    "llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you just use bind_tools(tools), the model can choose whether to return one tool call, multiple tool calls, or no tool calls at all. Some models support a tool_choice parameter that gives you some ability to force the model to call a tool. For models that support this, you can pass in the name of the tool you want the model to always call tool_choice=\"xyz_tool_name\". Or you can pass in tool_choice=\"any\" to force the model to call at least one tool, without specifying which tool specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently tool_choice=\"any\" functionality is supported by OpenAI, MistralAI, FireworksAI, and Groq. Currently Anthropic does not support tool_choice at all.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If tool calls are included in a LLM response, they are attached to the corresponding AIMessage or AIMessageChunk (when streaming) as a list of ToolCall objects in the .tool_calls attribute. A ToolCall is a typed dict that includes a tool name, dict of argument values, and (optionally) an identifier. Messages with no tool calls default to an empty list for this attribute.\n",
    "\n",

An InvalidToolCall can have a name, string arguments, identifier, and error message.\n",

Fields are optional because portions of a tool call may be streamed across different chunks (e.g., a chunk that includes a substring of the arguments may have null values for the tool name and id).\n",

    "### Chat Models and Structured Output\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often crucial to have LLMs return structured output. This is because oftentimes the outputs of the LLMs are used in downstream applications, where specific arguments are required. Having the LLM return structured output reliably is necessary for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different high level strategies that are used to do this:\n",
    "- Prompting: This is when you ask the LLM (very nicely) to return output in the desired format (JSON, XML). This is nice because it works with all LLMs. It is not nice because there is no guarantee that the LLM returns the output in the right format.\n",
    "- Function calling: This is when the LLM is fine-tuned to be able to not just generate a completion, but also generate a function call. The functions the LLM can call are generally passed as extra parameters to the model API. The function names and descriptions should be treated as part of the prompt (they usually count against token counts, and are used by the LLM to decide what to do).\n",
    "- Tool calling: A technique similar to function calling, but it allows the LLM to call multiple functions at the same time.\n",
    "- JSON mode: This is when the LLM is guaranteed to return JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different models may support different variants of these, with slightly different parameters. In order to make it easy to get LLMs to return structured output, we have added a common interface to LangChain models: .with_structured_output.\n",
    "\n",
    "By invoking this method (and passing in a JSON schema or a Pydantic model) the model will add whatever model parameters + output parsers are necessary to get back the structured output. There may be more than one way to do this (e.g., function calling vs JSON mode) - you can configure which method to use by passing into that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with OpenAI (supports Tool/function Calling):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field\n",

    "- HumanMessage: \n",

    "- AIMessage: \n",
    "    - Represents a message from the chat model. This can be either text or a request to invoke a tool.\n",
